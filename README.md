# IT Ops Incident Workflow Simulation

## üìå Project Overview
This project simulates a **real-world IT Operations workflow** by integrating:
- **Jira Service Management (JSM):** Incident and change tracking with SLAs and automation.
- **Active Directory (simulated):** User provisioning and access change requests with PowerShell automation.
- **Splunk:** Security log ingestion and alerting tied to Jira ticket creation.
- **pfSense:** Firewall logging and evidence generation for network incidents.

The goal is to demonstrate how enterprise IT teams **detect, track, and resolve incidents** across multiple systems while maintaining **audit trails and SLA compliance.**

## üöÄ Features Implemented
- **Custom Incident Request Type** in JSM with priority, root cause, and resolution fields.
- **SLA Tracking & Escalation Rules** (e.g., Critical tickets auto-escalate in 4 hours).
- **PowerShell AD Automation**: Mock user access report export attached to tickets.
- **Splunk Security Alert ‚Üí Jira Ticket**: Auto-created tickets for suspicious PowerShell execution.
- **Firewall Log Parsing**: pfSense/Bash script that simulates network alerts tied to incident tickets.
- **Audit Evidence Attachments**: Each incident ticket includes logs or reports as proof.

## üìù Example Ticket Lifecycle
1. Splunk detects a suspicious PowerShell execution.  
2. Alert triggers a Jira ticket via email integration.  
3. Analyst attaches AD audit evidence (PowerShell export).  
4. Ticket moves through workflow (*Open ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Resolved*).  
5. SLA timers ensure escalation if unresolved.  
6. Final ticket closed with resolution notes and logs attached.
