IT Ops Incident Workflow Simulation

End-to-end incident flow to demonstrate practical IT Ops & SecOps skills.
This project simulates detection, ticketing, SLA tracking, escalation, and evidence handling using free tools.

💡 Why This Matters

Employers want proof you can do the job — not just theory. This lab shows you can:

Ingest & detect real log data (Splunk Sysmon → suspicious PowerShell).

Triage & track incidents in a ticketing system with SLA timers (Jira).

Escalate & enforce SLAs when breaches occur.

Produce evidence using PowerShell exports for audit/compliance.

This isn’t just a demo — it mirrors how SOC and IT Ops teams actually run in enterprise environments. That’s the value you bring to the table.

🚀 What You’ll Build

An end-to-end workflow:
Detection → Ticketing → SLA → Escalation → Evidence
